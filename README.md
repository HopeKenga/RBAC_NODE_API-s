# RBAC_NODE_API-s

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a security model that allows access to resources in a system based on the roles assigned to users. In this model, users are assigned roles, and access to resources is granted based on those roles. RBAC helps to manage the permissions of different users based on their role, making it easier to maintain security in a system.

To implement RBAC in NodeJS, you can follow these steps:

Define roles: Define the roles and their associated permissions. For example, you can define a "user" role with read-only access to certain resources, and an "admin" role with full access.
Assign roles to users: Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities or job function. For example, a user who manages a certain resource may be assigned the "admin" role.
Create middleware: Create middleware functions that check the user's role before allowing access to a resource. For example, you can create a middleware function that checks if the user has the "admin" role before allowing access to a resource that requires administrative privileges.
Implement access control: Implement access control on the resources based on the user's role. For example, you can implement access control on a REST API endpoint that allows only users with the "admin" role to delete a resource.
